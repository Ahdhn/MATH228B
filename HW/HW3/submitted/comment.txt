Question 1: Part a: Results and discussion are good. Part b: Good comparison, does not go into theoretical or observed big-O. Part c: Correct, though non-ideal approach. Part d: Correct though overly verbose approach to theoretical demonstration. Implementation confirmed to match behavior. Question 2: Part a: Ambiguous/non-ideal presentation of fractional step method. Part b: Non-ideal discussion on reasoning for resolution/timestep (critera for test cases chosen?). Shown behavior does not match expected behavior. Part c: Behavior qualitatively matches expected behavior (spiral), but images of state, like part b, suggest an implementation error.
