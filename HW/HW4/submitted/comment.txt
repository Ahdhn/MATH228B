Question 1(Advection equation): Could improve presentation, demonstration of correct convergence. Part a (Smooth IC): Convergence study (UP): Missing comparison lines, but not obviously incorrect Convergence study (LW): Missing comparison lines, but not obviously incorrect Discussion: Not quite correct conclusions (1.85 suggesing 2nd order - actually would suggest implementation error since not at design order). Part b (Step IC): Convergence study (UP): Missing comparison lines, but not obviously incorrect Convergence study (LW): Missing comparison lines, but not obviously incorrect Discussion: Typos and wording could be improved. More detail could be considered. Question 2 (CN): Part a: Show unconditionally stable using VN analysis (also norm constant) (Y/N): Y Part b: Solve adv eqn: Solution: OK Commentary: Could elaborate on observed behavior. Part c: Compute relative phase error: Solution: OK Commentary: Conclusions do not quite fit data.
