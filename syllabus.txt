Homework
You are encouraged to talk with your classmates about homework problems. However, you must do your own write-up and write your own codes. All aspects of your write up must be clearly presented. Your writing should be clear and grammatically correct. Your codes must be thoroughly commented. All tables and figures must be appropriately labeled. You will be graded on the quality of your presentation. 


What we will cover
This coarse is part of the sequence 228A-C on numerical methods for partial differential equations. The second quarter (228B) will focus on time dependent problems. The topics we will cover this quarter are listed below. 
Introduction (Fourier transforms, derivation of conservation laws, parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs)
Numerical ODEs (briefly)
Stability, accuracy, and convergence
Von Neumann analysis
Diffusion (reaction-diffusion) equation in multiple dimensions
Nonrectangular geometry (logically quadrilateral grids and embedded grids)
Methods for advection equation in 1D
Dissipation and dispersion, modified equations
Hyperbolic conservation laws
Godunov method, wave propagation, and high-resolution methods
Grading
Your grade will be based on your homework assignments.  We will likely have 4 or 5 homework assignments during this quarter.

Programming
This class will require writing computer programs. You may use any language. If you do not have a strong preference of language, it is recommended that you use MATLAB, because it is easy to use and very powerful.  All codes will be turned in and must be thoroughly commented.
